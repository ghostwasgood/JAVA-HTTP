Hello :wave:

#### You need JAVA 18 to be able to test it: [Download JAVA](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk18-windows)

> **Functions:**

- HTTP REQUEST
- IP JSON LOOKUP

> HTTP REQUEST:
- It allows to receive the STATUS CODE and RESPONSE TEXT of a site.
> IP JSON LOOKUP
- It allows to analyze an IP obtaining its information in JSON format.
